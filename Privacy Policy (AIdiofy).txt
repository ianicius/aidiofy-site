Privacy Policy (AIdiofy)

Last updated: 2025-11-27

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use AIdiofy, our web application that converts scanned text into audio using TTS and AI models. We aim to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws.

1. Data controller
The controller of your personal data is:
Rafał Janicki
ul. Jagiellońska 36/42, 03-719 Warsaw, Poland
E-mail: rj@aidiofy.com
You can contact us regarding privacy at: rj@aidiofy.com

2. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the AIdiofy website, registered users of the web application, and future users of mobile applications (Android and iOS) once launched.
It covers personal data processed when you create and use an account, upload or submit content (text/images), generate audio, contact us or subscribe to a newsletter, and interact with our website (including cookies and analytics).

3. Categories of data we collect
Depending on how you use the Service, we may collect:
- Account data: e-mail address; authentication data (password hash if you register with e-mail/password, or tokens associated with third-party login such as Google).
- Usage data: information about how you use the Service (features used, frequency, timestamps); technical logs and events (e.g. request IDs, error logs).
- Device and connection data: IP address (with possible IP anonymization), browser type and version, operating system, approximate location derived from IP (city/country level).
- Content processed through the Service: text you submit (e.g. parts of manuals, descriptions, scenarios) and images you upload. This content is processed only to generate audio and is not stored long-term; it may appear temporarily in memory, caches, or short-term logs necessary for delivering the Service securely.
- Communication data: messages you send us via e-mail or contact forms; your preferences and consents (e.g. newsletter or optional use of content for improvement/marketing).
- Newsletter data (optional): e-mail address and any metadata related to newsletter subscriptions, if and when such a feature is offered.
We do not intentionally collect special categories of personal data and do not aim to identify you by biometric data. Avoid uploading sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.

4. Purposes and legal bases of processing
We process your personal data for the following purposes and on these legal bases:
- Providing and operating the Service (account creation, authentication, processing text/images to generate audio): performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
- Customer support and communication (responding to requests, handling bug reports or feedback): contract (Art. 6(1)(b)) and/or legitimate interest in responding to inquiries (Art. 6(1)(f)).
- Analytics and service improvement (understanding how users use the Service, improving performance/usability, detecting abuse or technical problems): legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)).
- Optional research and improvement using User Content / Generated Output: only if you explicitly opt in; legal basis: consent (Art. 6(1)(a)). You can withdraw this consent at any time.
- Newsletter and marketing communications (optional): only if you subscribe; legal basis: consent (Art. 6(1)(a)). You can unsubscribe at any time.
- Security and fraud prevention (monitoring for suspicious activity, protecting the Service and users from abuse, maintaining logs for security analysis): legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)).
- Legal obligations (tax, accounting, responding to lawful requests from authorities): compliance with legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c)).

5. Cookies and analytics
We may use cookies and similar technologies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and measure traffic and usage.
We use Google Analytics or similar tools to collect aggregate statistics about usage of the website and app. These tools may set cookies and process IP address (with IP anonymization, where technically enabled), browser and device information, pages visited, and actions taken.
Where required by law, we will display a cookie banner, give you the option to accept or reject non-essential cookies (e.g. analytics cookies), and allow you to change your cookie preferences.

6. Recipients of data and data processors
We may share your personal data with service providers (processors) that help us operate AIdiofy, such as:
- Google Cloud / Firebase (hosting, databases, backend infrastructure, EU data center settings),
- ElevenLabs (planned TTS provider),
- Stripe (payment processing),
- Google Analytics (analytics),
- e-mail service providers or newsletter tools (if used in the future).
These providers process personal data on our behalf and are bound by data processing agreements under Article 28 GDPR.
Public authorities may receive data if required by law or to protect our legitimate interests (e.g. investigating fraud or abuse).
We do not sell your personal data to third parties.

7. International data transfers
We aim to store and process data primarily within the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), for example by selecting EU-based regions in Google Cloud / Firebase.
However, some of our service providers (e.g. Stripe, ElevenLabs, Google) may be headquartered or have infrastructure outside the EEA, particularly in the United States.
In such cases, transfers of personal data outside the EEA will be based on appropriate safeguards, such as adequacy decisions by the European Commission (where applicable) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), plus additional technical and organizational measures (e.g. encryption, minimization).
You can contact us at rj@aidiofy.com for more information about international transfers and applicable safeguards.

8. Data retention
We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy and in line with legal requirements. Indicative retention periods:
- Account data (e-mail, login details): for as long as your account is active, and up to 1 year after you request account deletion, for security, fraud-prevention, and record-keeping purposes.
- Content processed via the Service (text/images, Generated Output): processed mainly ephemerally, only for the time necessary to generate the audio and deliver it to you; not stored long-term in our databases under the current design; may appear for a short time in technical logs or caches, which are then rotated or deleted.
- Technical logs (including IP address, usage events, error logs): retained for up to 12 months, unless a longer retention is needed in specific cases (e.g. incident investigation).
- Newsletter / marketing data: for as long as you are subscribed, or until you withdraw consent or unsubscribe.
- Data necessary for legal obligations (e.g. accounting): retained for the periods required by applicable law (which may be several years).
We may further anonymize data so that it is no longer personal data; anonymized data may be kept for longer for statistical and analytical purposes.

9. Data security
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including using reputable cloud infrastructure providers, limiting access to data to authorized persons, applying authentication and access controls, encrypting data in transit (HTTPS) and, where applicable, at rest, and monitoring for unusual activity and potential breaches.
No system is completely secure, but we strive to protect your personal data in line with industry practices. If we become aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will inform you and the relevant supervisory authority where required by law.

10. Your rights under GDPR
As a data subject under the GDPR, you have the right to:
- access the personal data we process about you,
- rectify inaccurate or incomplete data,
- erase personal data in certain circumstances (“right to be forgotten”),
- restrict processing in specific situations,
- data portability (receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format),
- object to processing based on legitimate interest (including profiling),
- object at any time to processing for direct marketing,
- withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent (withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal),
- lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
In Poland, the supervisory authority is the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (Prezes Urzędu Ochrony Danych Osobowych).
You can exercise your rights by contacting us at rj@aidiofy.com. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

11. Children’s privacy
The Service is not directed at children, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age required for valid consent in their country (e.g. 16 years under GDPR, subject to local variations).
If you believe that we have collected personal data from a child without appropriate consent, please contact us at rj@aidiofy.com, and we will take steps to delete such data.

12. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example due to changes in the Service, new legal or regulatory requirements, or improvements in how we explain our practices.
When we make material changes, we will notify you, for example by posting an updated version on our website and/or sending you an e-mail or in-app notification.
The updated Policy will take effect from the date indicated at the top (“Last updated”), unless otherwise required by law.
