# Stop Listening to Page Numbers: The Guide to Headache-Free RPG Audio

**Meta Description:** Does your TTS app read "Page 42" and stat blocks instead of the story? Discover how context-aware AI removes the junk from your RPG PDFs for smooth audio prep.

If you've ever tried to use text-to-speech for RPG prep, you know exactly what I mean by "The Garbage Stream."

You're doing dishes. You've got your headphones in. The app is reading you this incredible chunk of lore about an ancient empire that fell to a curse, and you're actually getting into it—picturing the crumbling temples, the fleeing refugees, the whole thing.

And then:

"...Strength 16, Dexterity 12, Constitution 14. See Table 5.2 for grappling modifiers. Page 42. HEADER: Chapter Four. Subheader: The Ruins of—"

Gone. Whatever mental picture you were building? Shattered by a stat block and a page number.

This is the reality of listening to RPG PDFs. They're not novels. They're a chaotic mess of flavor text crammed next to stat blocks, sidebars interrupting paragraphs, legal text buried in footers, and random "SEE PAGE 114" callouts that made sense on paper but sound insane out loud.

And standard TTS apps? They don't care. Text is text. They'll read you the ISBN number with the same enthusiasm as a villain's dying words.

## The Trap I Kept Falling Into

For a while, I thought I'd found a workaround. I'd copy the text from the PDF, paste it into Google Docs, and manually delete all the garbage. Headers, footers, stat blocks, page references—gone. Clean text, ready for audio.

Except... that took forever? Like, genuinely 20-30 minutes per chapter. Sometimes longer if the PDF formatting was weird and everything pasted as one giant paragraph.

At some point I did the math and realized I was spending more time *cleaning text* than I would have spent just reading the damn book. The "time-saving tool" had become a second job.

## What Actually Needed to Happen

The problem isn't text-to-speech itself. The problem is that most TTS apps are basically screen readers with better voices. They have no idea what they're looking at. A dramatic monologue and a stat block are identical to them—just characters in a row.

For this to actually work for RPGs, the app needs to understand *structure*. It needs to look at a page and go: "Okay, this block is stats, this is a sidebar about optional rules, and THIS is the actual story content the person wants to hear."

That's what we built AIdiofy's pre-processing around. Before anything gets turned into audio, an LLM scans the content and basically does the janitor work for you:

Stat blocks get flagged and skipped (or summarized, if you want). Headers and footers and page numbers disappear. What's left is the narrative flow—the lore, the dialogue, the descriptions. The stuff you actually need in your head before a session.

## Why This Actually Matters

Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: prep kills campaigns. Not bad players, not scheduling conflicts—*prep burnout*. GMs get tired of the work-before-the-work and sessions just... stop getting scheduled.

Anything that reduces friction is worth it. And "upload a PDF, get clean audio back" is a lot less friction than "upload a PDF, spend 30 minutes in Google Docs, then get audio."

You could listen to a module on your commute and actually absorb the story instead of having "Goblin. Hit Points. 7. Armor Class. 15." rattling around your brain.
