# How Board Gamers Actually Deal With Language Barriers (And What We Learned From It)

**Meta Description:** Board gamers get creative with language barriers—sleeving cards, using Google Lens, hiring "lectors." What BoardGameGeek taught us about turning text into audio for gaming.

You backed a Kickstarter. Waited eighteen months. The box finally arrives. You crack it open and... everything's in English. The adventure book is 200 pages. The cards have paragraphs of text. You need a magnifying glass.

Sound familiar?

I went deep into BoardGameGeek forums to see how gamers actually solve this problem. Turns out, the method depends mostly on one thing: **how much text you're dealing with**.

## When There Are Too Many Cards: Physical Solutions

For games with dozens of text-heavy cards (*Arkham Horror*, *Gloomhaven*), players go physical.

**Sleeves save lives.** Print the translation on regular paper, cut it out, slide it into the sleeve with the original card. Doesn't damage anything. You can reverse it anytime. Plus, sleeves protect cards anyway.

For people who want something cleaner, there are **clear adhesive labels**. You stick them directly on the card, and the text almost blends into the artwork. Takes more work, but looks better.

The true enthusiasts? They scan cards, edit in Photoshop, print from scratch. Time-consuming, but the result is perfect.

## When There's Too Much Text: Time to Go Digital

Now picture a game with a 200-page adventure book. Or an RPG where every session means hours of reading descriptions. Physically translating that? Forget it.

This is where players go digital.

**Google Lens** is the first port in a storm. Point your phone at text and instantly see the translation. Works great for quick checks on individual cards.

For longer texts? **DeepL** wins on literary translation quality. Drop in a chunk of adventure book and get something that actually makes narrative sense. ChatGPT helps too, especially when you need summaries or explanations of complicated rules.

More people are also buying adventure books as PDFs instead of physical. On a tablet, you can copy text with one click, throw it into a translator, search for keywords. The book just sits there collecting dust.

## Gameplay Methods That Actually Work

Sometimes you don't need to translate everything. You just change how you play.

In co-op games, the **lector method** works—one person who knows English reads and translates on the fly. Takes practice, but after a few sessions it becomes natural.

You can also make a **reference card**—one-page cheat sheet with the most important effects and mechanics in your language. You don't modify the game, but you have everything at hand.

## What You Won't Find in Any Store

BoardGameGeek has a "Files" section under every game. Players upload their own rulebook translations, reference cards, sometimes entire decks of translated cards ready to print.

That's the first place you should check. Someone probably already did a chunk of the work for you.

## Why We Built AIdiofy

You see this problem from a player's perspective. We see it every day.

People sit at the table with their phones, photographing cards, waiting for translations. The session drags. Immersion dies. Eventually someone says "screw it" and just plays in English while half the table zones out.

The physical solutions work great for cards. But once you hit story-heavy games—*Oathsworn*, *Sleeping Gods*, *7th Continent*—you're dealing with books. Hundreds of pages. You can't sleeve a book. You can't paste-up an adventure journal.

And this is where it clicked for us: **the problem isn't cards. It's narrative text.**

## The Thing Nobody Talks About

When you're sitting at a table, reading from your phone breaks everything. You're hunched over, squinting at a screen, stumbling through a translation that sounds robotic because Google Translate doesn't do nuance.

But what if you didn't have to read it at all?

What if the adventure book just... talked? In your language. With actual emotion. A threatening villain sounds threatening. A dying character sounds tragic. The narrator stays neutral so it doesn't compete with the story.

That's what we built AIdiofy for. Not to replace the physical game. To solve the part where text becomes a barrier between you and the experience.

## How It Actually Works

You scan or upload the text. AIdiofy processes it—strips out the junk (stat blocks, page numbers, headers), keeps the story. Then it casts it.

The narrator gets a clear, neutral voice. The villain gets something menacing. The shopkeeper sounds annoying. The mysterious stranger sounds... mysterious.

You're not just converting text to speech. You're directing a performance.

And you can do this while prepping, not at the table. Load it onto your phone, hit play during the session. Your players hear the story. You don't break immersion fumbling with your phone.

## The BGG Community Got It Right

BoardGameGeek players figured out years ago that different problems need different solutions. Cards get sleeved. Long texts get translated digitally. Shared resources save everyone time.

We're just adding another tool to that toolbox. One specifically built for the "I have 200 pages of narrative text and I want to experience it without my eyes glazing over" problem.

Because honestly? Scanning cards with Google Lens works. Paste-ups look great. Community translations are amazing.

But nobody should have to choose between reading a book for four hours or missing half the story.

Stop reading adventure books. Start hearing them.
