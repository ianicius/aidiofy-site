# Meaning What You Say: How to "Direct" AI Voices for Tabletop Immersion

**Meta Description:** Learn how to use emotional tags to direct AI voices for your tabletop RPG. Turn flat reading into screaming, whispering, and sarcastic performances.

There's a massive difference between saying "I am going to kill you" and *screaming* it.

There's a difference between whispering a secret and reading it in your normal speaking voice. One makes people lean in. The other makes them check their phones.

And for years, this is exactly where TTS has been stuck. Even the "good" voices—the ones that don't sound like robots anymore—they all have this... *tone*. I call it "Newscaster Mode." Pleasant, clear, perfectly enunciated. Great for audiobooks. Terrible for a villain threatening to feed your players to his demon lord.

The words are right. The *intent* is completely missing.

A villain who sounds polite isn't scary. A dying NPC who sounds exactly like a shopkeeper isn't tragic. Your ghost can't haunt anyone if she sounds like a chipper virtual assistant.

## You're Not Just a Writer—You're a Director

Here's what's actually changed recently: modern voice engines can finally take direction. Not just "use this voice" but "say it *like this*."

We built this into AIdiofy as Director Tags. They work like stage directions in a script—you're not just giving the AI words, you're giving it intent.

So instead of:

> "Don't look behind you."

You write:

> [whisper] "Don't look behind you."

And instead of:

> "Get to the bridge! Now!"

You write:

> [shouting] "Get to the bridge! Now!"

Other examples that actually work well:
- `[sarcastic]` — for that one NPC who's done with the party's nonsense
- `[nervous]` — shopkeeper who's clearly hiding something  
- `[exhausted]` — the messenger who ran three days to deliver the warning
- `[cold]` — villain who doesn't need to raise their voice to be terrifying

The Pro-tier engines we use are finally good enough to interpret these cues. It's not perfect every time—sometimes you need to rephrase or try a different tag—but when it hits? It *hits*.

## Where This Actually Makes a Difference

If you run games online (Foundry, Roll20, Discord) or even in-person with a speaker setup, audio is insanely underutilized. Everyone's got ambient music playlists. Almost nobody has NPC dialogue ready to go.

Picture this: your players walk into a tavern. Instead of you saying "the barkeep looks annoyed and tired," you tap a button and they hear:

> *[irritated, tired]* "Look—buy something or get out. I don't have the patience for adventurers today."

That lands different. It sets a tone instantly without you having to "do a voice" after five hours of GMing.

And yeah, doing voices is fun. But sometimes your throat is shot, or you're running three NPCs in one scene, or you just want to preserve your energy for the big moments. Having directed audio as a backup means you can pick your battles.

## The Catch (Because There's Always a Catch)

Director tags aren't magic. Some emotions work better than others depending on the voice you've picked. [whisper] is pretty reliable. [sarcastic] can be hit-or-miss—sarcasm is hard even for humans to convey without context.

The trick is treating it like actual directing: if the first take doesn't work, try a different angle. Swap [angry] for [cold]. Try [bitter] instead of [sarcastic]. The more specific you get, the better results you usually get.

Your script already has emotion in it. Now your audio can too.
